# Contents

I had scrapped data from two websites that I used to build the regression model. Below given are the websites that I have scraped data from and the notebooks that I have used. It also has the Dockerfile that I used to containerize the scraping files and the requirements.txt file for building the container.

 - **Scraping_link_1.ipynb**: Script for scraping from the first website
   - https://offcampus.osu.edu/search-housing.aspx
   
- **Scraping_link_2.ipynb**: Script for scraping from the second website
  - https://www.apartmentguide.com/apartments/Ohio/Ohio-State-University/

- **sample_data.csv**, **sample_data_2.csv** and **scrapped_listing.csv** are examples of sample data that I scrapped from the links above.
